# BCB546-PythonHW_Spring2021
Repository for code and data involved in completing the Python homework for BCB546 at Iowa State University in Spring 2021


Full documentation can be found in the jupyter notebook "BCB546-PythonHW_Spring2021.ipynb"

If you plan to run my code you will need to pull "bears_cytb.fasta" and "bears_mass.csv" as well as install dependencies listed at the top of the notebook.
